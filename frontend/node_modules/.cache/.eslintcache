Our predisposition to love plants\n                has a name: Biophilia. It’s defined as our tendency to prefer\n                natural environments as a result of evolution. Research shows\n                that because we have such a strong positive association with\n                plants, their absence in our lives can actually cause physical\n                and mental stress. Today, people spend more time inside of\n                buildings than ever before, especially in urban areas, which\n                drastically reduces our interactions with nature, including open\n                skies, fresh air, and lush greenery. With limited access to\n                forests, gardens and even backyards, our only means of spending\n                quality time in nature requires special visits to parks and\n                beaches or day trips outside of the city.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"Synopsis-highlightLine five\"></div>\n            <div className=\"animated fadeIn four\">\n              <p className=\"regular-text\">\n                We don't just want to push you plants: we want to help you\n                realize how easy it can be to take care of them.
