                We don't just want to sell you plants, we want to sell you on
                planting. We are building a community of urban gardeners who
                aspire to cultivate cleaner, happier lives. Our focus is
                primarily on urban dwellers, as we live in one of the densest
                places in the world, New York City. There is an overload of
                information about plants and plant care to be found on the
                Internet and in horty culture books, but it is not specifically
                targeted to people like us who live in small spaces.

                Plant Therapy Is a Real Thing. Our predisposition to love plants
                has a name: Biophilia. It’s defined as our tendency to prefer
                natural environments as a result of evolution. Research shows
                that because we have such a strong positive association with
                plants, their absence in our lives can actually cause physical
                and mental stress. Today, people spend more time inside of
                buildings than ever before, especially in urban areas, which
                drastically reduces our interactions with nature, including open
                skies, fresh air, and lush greenery. With limited access to
                forests, gardens and even backyards, our only means of spending
                quality time in nature requires special visits to parks and
                beaches or day trips outside of the city.

                We don't just want to push you plants: we want to help you
                realize how easy it can be to take care of them. Plants are an
                intimate part of our lives—we live with them and love them every
                day—and we want to share this lifestyle with you by carefully
                curating kits with hardy plants that will ease your anxiety
                about greenery care. We have thoughtfully designed our
                subscription service as a program that will take you through
                different levels of plant care. We'll provide you with all the
                tools, tips, and hardy plants. Whether you are a plant newbie or
                an aesthete who wants to acquire some tasteful new planting

                We started this company to share our love for plants with our
                friends, and we would love to have you in our circle. By sharing
                this contagiously good lifestyle with you, we hope you will do
                the same for others. Evidence shows that humans thrive in the
                presence of plants and trees, and plants are even more essential
                in the concrete jungles of urban centers—so let us help you and
                your friends bring these little wonders into your home.
